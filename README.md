# mastermind

An implementation of the game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game).

See a description of the game's data structure in `doc/mastermind-data-model.txt`.  I attempted to create this data model first then build up the transformation functions.

My notes are in `doc/notes.md` and were written as I was implementing this code.
